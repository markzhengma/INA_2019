\'a0challenges\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/artificial-intelligence"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 Artificial Intelligence}}\'a0in many regards: dynamic, partially unknown environments that were not originally designed for robots; a broad variety of situations with rich semantics to understand and interpret; physical interactions with humans that requires fine, low-latency yet socially acceptable\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/control-strategy"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 control strategies}}; natural and multi-modal communication which mandates\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/common-sense-knowledge"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 common-sense knowledge}}\'a0and the representation of possibly divergent mental models. This article is an attempt to characterise these challenges and to exhibit a set of key decisional issues that need to be addressed for a cognitive robot to successfully share space and tasks with a human.\
We identify first the needed individual and collaborative\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/cognitive-skill"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 cognitive skills}}: geometric reasoning and situation assessment based on perspective-taking and affordance analysis; acquisition and representation of knowledge models for\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/multiple-agents"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 multiple agents}}\'a0(humans and robots, with their specificities); situated, natural and multi-modal dialogue; human-aware task planning; human\'96robot joint task achievement. The article discusses each of these abilities, presents working implementations, and shows how they combine in a coherent and original deliberative architecture for human\'96robot interaction. Supported by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/experimental-result"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 experimental results}}, we eventually show how\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/explicit-knowledge"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 explicit knowledge}}\'a0management, both symbolic and geometric, proves to be instrumental to richer and more natural human\'96robot interactions by pushing for pervasive, human-level semantics within the robot's deliberative system.\
